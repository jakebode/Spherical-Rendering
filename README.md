# Spherical-Rendering
This is my introductory project to WebGL and 3D graphics libraries.
The goal is to learn WebGL2 and to apply mathematical concepts to 3d graphics. I created an icosahedron in WebGL, as a 3d object, then, upon calling a subdivision routine multiple times, made the 3d shape appear to be spherical, mapping textures to the object.
